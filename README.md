"Clock In" is a website developed to help students study and complete tasks. Complete with an ascending study timer, as well as a schedule builder, Clock In is a comfortable, customizable website that offers a study experience for students, by students.

Why the "Ascending" Study Timer?
If someone were to work for 20 minutes, rather than count down from 20:00, the clock will start at 00:00 and ascend to the 20 minute mark. This is because according to work done in a study, an increasing timer makes users feel more accomplished, and feel less stressed.
This approach is integral to ensure that someone with low self-efficacy can feel positive when studying and feel more motivated to complete their tasks.

The Schedule Builder
Users place the tasks they need to complete in a day as well as their availability hours, and prioirty of completion. Using different interval scheduling algorithms, the schedule builder creates 3 possible schedules of completion, allowing for users to decide how to break up their time.

Future Implementations

- Database implementation for personalized log ins
- AI generated random mindfulness reminders (eg. "Don't forget to hydrate!")
- Implementation of compatability with Google Calendar/Apple Calendar
